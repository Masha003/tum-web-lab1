            <b>Favorite Course:</b> Design Patterns – This course significantly improved my understanding of software architecture and best practices. Learning about creational, structural, and behavioral patterns helped me write cleaner, more maintainable code. One of the most rewarding moments was implementing multiple design patterns in a real-world project, which made me appreciate their power in structuring software efficiently.

            <b>Memorable Experience:</b> Organizing the FAF x Sigmoid Summer Hackathon was one of the most challenging yet rewarding experiences during my university years. Managing logistics, coordinating with sponsors, and ensuring everything ran smoothly for participants required strong teamwork and problem-solving skills. Seeing teams innovate under time pressure and witnessing the excitement during project presentations made all the hard work worthwhile. It was a great opportunity to contribute to the tech community while also strengthening my leadership and organizational abilities.

              This project aims to create a modern and user-friendly petitioning platform that empowers individuals to express their opinions effectively. In the Republic of Moldova, existing platforms for public petitions are often outdated, difficult to navigate, and fail to prioritize user needs. To bridge this gap, we propose a secure, intuitive, and efficient solution tailored for students at the Technical University of Moldova (UTM) as an initial target audience.            </p>
